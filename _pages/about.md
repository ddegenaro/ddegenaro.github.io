I'm an incoming PhD student at Georgetown University, where I will be working with [Dr. Sarah Bargal](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/0031Q00002cJxDQQA0/sarah-bargal) on multimodal intelligent systems -- those that integrate text, vision, and other forms of data such as audio. I'm also affiliated with the [PICoL Lab](https://github.com/picol-georgetown/wiki) led by [Dr. Ethan Wilcox](https://wilcoxeg.github.io/).

I am interested in the development of safe, ethical, and energy-efficient multimodal intelligent systems that serve the needs of everyday people while respecting important rights such as privacy, copyright, and the right to be forgotten.

I am also interested in low-resource machine translation and speech recognition, multilingual NLP, and information-theoretic approaches to language modeling and linguistics.
