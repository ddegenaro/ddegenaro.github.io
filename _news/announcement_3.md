With colleagues at JHU, ["MMMORRF: Multimodal Multilingual Modularized Reciprocal Rank Fusion"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20698), was accepted to SIGIR 2025 as a demo paper.

This paper was submitted to Shared Task 1 in the [AmericasNLP 2024 Workshop](https://turing.iimas.unam.mx/americasnlp/2025_workshop.html), co-located with NAACL 2024. We found that a careful fine-tuning curriculum was quite helpful in improving the performance of a pre-trained MT model on low-resource languages. Our submission won second place in the shared task!
