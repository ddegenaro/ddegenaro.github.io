With my colleague, Tom Lupicki, I presented our paper, ["Experiments in Mamba Sequence Modeling and NLLB-200 Fine-Tuning for Low Resource Multilingual Machine Translation"](https://aclanthology.org/2024.americasnlp-1.22/), at NAACL 2024.

This paper was submitted to Shared Task 1 in the [AmericasNLP 2024 Workshop](https://turing.iimas.unam.mx/americasnlp/2025_workshop.html), co-located with NAACL 2024. We found that a careful fine-tuning curriculum was quite helpful in improving the performance of a pre-trained MT model on low-resource languages. Our submission won second place in the shared task!
