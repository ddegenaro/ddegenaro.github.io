I tell people looking to get into NLP that this book is the *sacra biblia* of NLP. My crash course introduction to neural networks and deep learning was chapters 6 through 9 of this book. I first read those chapters in 2022 in a single week as preparation for an REU. I was impressed with how simple it was to understand the algorithms they introduced (though my nearly-completed undergraduate degrees in physics and math were certainly important factors in that outcome).
